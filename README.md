# Project300
My third year final project on formal software verification of an electronic voting system.

The core classes of this project have been formally verified using JML and OpenJML. The core classes are Ballot, Voter and PollingStation.
To formally verify the core classes, you will need to install OpenJML and download the appropriate zip file from OpenJML’s GitHub repository for your machine. Unzip the file into a directory of your choice. 
Once it has been fully unzipped, there should an executable called ‘openjml’. This will be the executable that will be used for all OpenJML commands.

There are also testing suites to test the core classes with additional unit tests.

The HTML5 folder contains HTML5 files that display what the UI for this project should look like. The HTML5 files are not connected to the Java code.
Copies of the HMTL5 code are implemented within the Java class Html as string objects.

Version control for this project was conducted in a GitLab repository on a student account assiocated with Lancaster University. The contents of this project have been moved here to show case my experience in formal software verification and also unit testing in Java.
