# Project300
My third year final project on formal software verification of an electronic voting system.

The core classes of this project have been formally verified using JML and OpenJML. The core classes are Ballot, Voter and PollingStation.
There are also testing suites to test the core classes with additional unit tests.

The HTML5 folder contains HTML5 files that display what the UI for this project should look like. The HTML5 files are not connected to the Java code.
Copies of the HMTL5 code are implemented within the Java class Html as string objects.
